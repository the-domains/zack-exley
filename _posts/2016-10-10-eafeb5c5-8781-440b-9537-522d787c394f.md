  I work with a team at a small company called Middle Seat. If you’re excited
  about the impact you’re making in the world, or the impact you could be
  making, we would love to help you with organizing, digital marketing, web
  design, software development, fundraising, A/B testing or anything else you
  might need. We love working on innovative and impossible projects that seek to
  bring people together in new ways using technology and organizing. So if
  you're working on something like that, I'd love to hear about it! Drop me a
  line at zack@middleseat.co
