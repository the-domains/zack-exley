  My wife Elizabeth, my daughter Esther, and I live in a tiny Missouri Ozarks
  town — Elizabeth’s home town. I travel too much, but when they’re in the mood
  for an adventure, the family comes along. Esther loves to travel and knows her
  way around half the science museums in America. Each city is “my favorite
  ever” and it really is. But then she’ll say something like, “I’m 20% sad that
  we’re leaving here, but 80% happy that we’re going home!”

My wife Elizabeth, my daughter Esther, and I live in a tiny Missouri Ozarks town --- Elizabeth's home town. I travel too much, but when they're in the mood for an adventure, the family comes along. Esther loves to travel and knows her way around half the science museums in America. Each city is "my favorite ever" and it really is. But then she'll say something like, "I'm 20% sad that we're leaving here, but 80% happy that we're going home!"
