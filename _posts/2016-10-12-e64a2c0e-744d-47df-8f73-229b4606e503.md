  Becky Bond and I wrote a book! Please get yourself a copy. Becky and I would
  be happy to speak to your group or organization about organizing. “Rules for
  Revolutionaries is a bold challenge to the political establishment and the
  ‘rules’ that govern campaign strategy. It tells the story of a breakthrough
  experiment conducted on the fringes of the Bernie Sanders presidential
  campaign: a technology-driven team empowered volunteers to build and manage
  the infrastructure to make 75 million calls, launch 8 million text messages,
  and hold more than 100,000 public meetings—in an effort to put Bernie’s
  insurgent campaign over the top.” Just email my name @ gmail and I’ll get back
  to you.
