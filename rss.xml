            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hello!</h1><p>Don't know what brought you here, but since you asked, here's a little bit about me: I just got off the Bernie Sanders campaign where I was honored to work alongside thousands of amazing grassroots leaders who made miracles happen. Now I'm joining some of them to launch Brand New Congress, a campaign to replace the entire corrupt U.S. Congress with a slate of honest and visionary working people. BNC is a volunteer-led organization, and I participate as a part time volunteer. I love reading history, economics, religion and philosophy. I've spent a lot of time studying how countries that were very poor became prosperous, and have spent a lot of time thinking about how America can learn from those cases (including our own story!) to rebuild our economy.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4a278080-5e40-444c-9f53-258ee5442e84.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[A Book!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Book!</h1><p>Becky Bond and I wrote a book! It comes out November 18th. “Rules for Revolutionariesis a bold challenge to the political establishment and the ‘rules’ that govern campaign strategy. It tells the story of a breakthrough experiment conducted on the fringes of the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign: a technology-driven team empowered volunteers to build and manage the infrastructure to make 75 million calls, launch 8 million text messages, and hold more than 100,000 public meetings—in an effort to put Bernie’s insurgent campaign over the top.”</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7740c9c5-620d-414d-9b70-af2eff4e2d6d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
